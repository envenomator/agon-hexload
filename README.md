# HEXLOAD utility
## Purpose
Playing microSD jockey during assemble/compile/transfer/test/debug cycles is no fun at all. I'd like to shorten this cycle significantly by removing the need to physically bring over new binaries to the Agon.

With the hexload command you are able to transmit Intel I32 hex files to one of the Agon serial ports and run your code immediately from memory.

## Installation
Copy 'hexload.bin' and 'hexload.dll' to the \mos\ directory on the microSD card. If no such directory exists, create it first. This allows the usage of arguments to the utility and loading it using it's base name.

The utility requires at least MOS version 1.02. Transfering data over the ESP USB port requires at least MOS version 1.04.

## Usage

    hexload <uart1 [baudrate] | vdp> [filename]

Start the hexload receiver client on the Agon first, using a serial connectivity option as described below and *then* transfer Intel hex content from your PC to the serial interface. As Intel hex content doesn't provide a feedback mechanism to the sender, nor is there an option for hardware handshaking to control the flow between sender and hexload receiver, the receiver needs to be running *before* any transfer is started. If you do start the sender first, and the hexload receiver client later, it may just pick up what is left in the transmit buffer, transfering some content, but certainly not everything. In that case, just retry the process using the correct startup order.


The serial connectivity options are:
1. The UART1 serial port can be used at the external GPIO serial pins PC0/TxD1, PC1/RxD1 and GND. Connect to external serial interfaces (3.3v), like for example a USB-Serial FTDI adapter

2. The ESP USB port that powers the Agon can be used, using the serial-over-USB interface it provides, without requiring a separate interface. This requires a VDP version of at least 1.04. As the serial settings are hardcoded in the VDP, there is no option to set the baudrate in the hexload client.

### Baudrate
The uart1 option has a selectable baudrate. If no baudrate is given, the default of 384000 is selected. The vdp option uses a hardcoded 115200 by default and isn't selectable in the hexload client. The actual baudrate used is echoed to the user at startup.

**Please be aware** that **achievable** baudrates in **your** setup may be much lower than this. Some users report baud rates well below 115200. The **achievable** baudrate without errors during transmission in your setup, will depend on factors like quality of your FTDI adapter, which IC is on it, which driver is loaded into the operating system for it to function, your operating system itself, but also which USB interface you are plugging it into.

Upon first use, it appears prudent to set an initially LOW baudrate value, potentially as low as 57600, or even 9600, to verify transmission. And only after this initial verification ramp up the speed an next attempts to see where you end up with your specific setup.

### Dump to file
The transfered data is dumped to a file when a filename is appended as last option. This is an add-on option; the data is always stored to memory at the location given in the Intel Hex file (or default address). 

### Difference in feedback during transmission
During reception of Intel Hex files on the UART1, no feedback is given to the user before transmission is terminated by a 01 record. There is not enough CPU available to handle output while also processing the input at high speed.
Using the VDP does allow for feedback to the user during transmission. The VDP informs the user of every address record sent.

### Sending files
Intel Hex files must be sent in ascii format, over one of the serial interfaces. I have provided an example send.py python script to automate this process, converting binary files to hex files on the fly before transfer. The script tries to autodetect your serial port. If autodetection doesn't work, provide serial port and speed as argument to the script, or edit the relevant default settings in the script.

    send.py filename <port> <baudrate>

Due to the way the VDP/serial interface is wired up (to bootstrap the ESP32 for programming), the board usually resets when the serial interface opens/closes. This means that a waiting hexload client is suddenly gone when a transfer is started. To avoid this, the script tries to set the DTR/CTS signals explicitly before starting the transfer. Boards with the CH340 FTDI chip may reset just the first time after power-up and not later on. Your mileage may vary; just press the reset button and try again, in the correct order.

### UART1 pinout
- Tx: GPIO pin PC0 - connect to your adapter serial Rx
- Rx: GPIO pin PC1 - connect to your adapter serial Tx

## Start address
The hexload utility will load the Intel Hex file to memory, according to the specified 'Extended Lineair Address' records in the file itself. If you want to load a program to a specific address, you'll need make sure that whatever creates your Intel Hex file sets the addresses appropriately for the Agon platform.
The hexload utility doesn't check for invalid address ranges like the flash, or MOS ranges.

When no address records are found in the Intel Hex file; the default load address 0x040000 will be used.
